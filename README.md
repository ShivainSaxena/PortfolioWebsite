  <p>This website is created using React.js and is hosted on Netlify. On the site you  will find some of my most recent projects, developer skills, and past experiences. Libraries that were used were Material UI and Framer Motion. The goal was to create a responsive and unique website that had many animations and a dynamic feel. The site was optimized for all devices and screen sizes ranging from small phones to large monitors using responsive typography, media queries, and a fluid layout.</p>
